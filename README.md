# Databricks DAB Examples 

This repository provides a collection of example projects demonstrating various use cases and best practices for 
Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs). Each folder in this repo contains a self-contained project showcasing different aspects 
of DAB functionality and best practices for developer workflow and CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment).

## Repo Structure

The repository is organized into multiple folders, each representing a distinct project:
- [`flights/flights-simple`](flights/flights-simple):Recommended starting demo, this is a simple end to end project with workflows & DLT, source code (simple library), tests 
- [`flights/flights-advanced`](flights/flights-advanced): Advanced project that adds many more examples of asset bundle features in an end to end project. This is the one the GitHub Action workflows in .github/workflows/ are setup to use.
- [`flights/flights-bundle-template`](flights/flights-bundle-template): Bundle template to deploy a version of `flights-simple` with different options:
  - classic or serverless workflows
  - library packaged as wheel or using relative imports
- [`other_examples/dais-2024-dab-mod-orch-template`](other_examples/dais-2024-dab-mod-orch-template): Simple template for DAB
- [`other_examples/uv_bundle`](other_examples/uv_bundle) DAB project that includes uv as a package manager. Also includes unit testing examples with [databricks-connect](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-connect/python)
- [`sts-dabs-demo`](sts-dabs-demo) DABs simple project that includes many CICD pipeline definitions


## Getting Started
The structure of each of the folders varies according to the purpose of the project, but will include:
- A `README.md` with specific instructions
- Configuration files (such as a `databricks.yml` file defining the bundle, other YAMLs for resources)
- Source and test code

To use a project in a folder:
- Navigate to the desired folder
- Review the README for instructions
- Examine the configuration and other to understand the bundle structure
- Follow the instructions to deploy and test the bundle


## Installation

The installation of the Databricks CLI is a pre-requisite for running any of the projects.
